# Solution
Create a Python script running in Google Colab that converts the provided markdown meeting notes into a well-formatted Google Doc.
# Google Docs Meeting Notes Generator

This script automates the creation of formatted Google Docs meeting notes from markdown content. It uses the Google Docs API to generate a structured document with headings, bullet points, checkboxes, and styled text (bold, italic) based on markdown syntax.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Google Account Authentication**:  
   The script requires access to your Google Drive. You will be prompted to authenticate via Google Colab when running the code.

2. **Google Colab Environment**:  
   Ensure you are using Google Colab, as the script leverages Colab-specific authentication.

## Required Dependencies

- `google-api-python-client` (for Google API interactions)
- `google-auth` (authentication handling)

These are pre-installed in Google Colab. If running locally, install them via:
```bash
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth


How to Run in Colab
1. Open a New Notebook:
Go to Google Colab and start a new notebook.

2. Paste the Code:
Copy the provided solution code into a code cell. Replace the empty markdown_content variable with your meeting notes in markdown format. For example:
markdown_content = """
# Meeting Title - Date
## Attendees
- @Alice (Team Lead)
## Agenda
- [ ] Task 1
"""

3. Run the Script:
Execute the cell. Follow the authentication prompts to grant access to your Google Drive. A new Google Doc will be created and formatted automatically.

4. Access the Document:
After execution, the script prints a URL to the newly created Google Doc (replace [doc_id] in the output with the actual ID from the console).

Notes
Ensure your markdown follows the supported syntax (headings #, ##, ###, bullets -, checkboxes - [ ], and mentions @username).

The script may require debugging for syntax errors (e.g., typos in the provided code like line[2]:strip() should be line[2:].strip()).
